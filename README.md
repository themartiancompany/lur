# Local User Repository

The Lur is the local user repository manager of
the
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/lur)
uncensorable, undeletable, Life and DogeOS user repository
and app store.

### Usage

To build a manually downloaded Ur package
or to automatically retrieve one,
run from the directory containing an universal recipe
user repo:

```bash
lur \
  <ur_package_name>
```

The Lur depends on
[aspe](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany)
to retrieve universal recipes
and on
[reallymakepkg](
  https://github.com/themartiacompany/reallymakepkg)
to build them.

The Lur is written using the
[Crash Bash](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/crash-bash)
library.

## Installation

The program in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

or even run directly

```bash
bash \
  lur/lur
```

The lur has officially published on the
the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
user repository and application store as
`lur`.
The source code is published on the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
so it can't possibly be taken down.

To install it from there just type

```bash
ur \
  lur
```

A censorable HTTP Github mirror of the recipe published there,
containing a full list of the software dependencies needed to run the
tools is hosted on
[lur-ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/lur-ur).

A censorable binary package has been published on the
[Fallback User Repository](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/fur)
and it can be installed with
```bash
ur \
  lur
```

Be aware the mirrors could go offline any time as Github and more
in general all HTTP resources are inherently unstable and censorable.
